# Strava Running Title/Description Automation - Guide

It is amazing you have decided to venture this far into this project to the point of using it yourself. Anyways, here is a guide on how to use this program yourself, assuming the setup has been completed as instructed.

Note: this guide cannot possibly every use case, so beware and experiment with the program or read the source code to have a better understanding of its logic.

## Input
The program relies on a JSON configuration file as input. The expected file is `data/config.json`, meaning the `data` sub-folder must be created for use alongside the corresponding file.

The input is non-trivial, and it is significantly simpler to rely on an example input file rather than explain every tiny detail. Check out the `example_config.json` file for a sample configuration file you can directly copy and edit for your own use cases:
